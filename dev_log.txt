2015.02.07 : Added theme and features
	* Bootstrap simple sidebar
	* angular-filter
	* added configuration screen, don't like it but it's a start
	* refactored and moved things around the tree
	* works in Chrome (LOL)

2015.02.04 : Concept and beginning of the project.
Things to knock out:
	* [done] Create data model
	* [done] Create the flash card interface (done : phase 1)
	* [done] Create the question loop. (simple top to bottom list navigation)
	* Establish cookie that lets us resume where we left off on a page refresh.
	* Create reset/restart option
	* Create game setup (choose Books/Chapters to be quizzed on, choose ordered or shuffled.)
		- to begin with it will just be all cards in order so I can at least give the kids something. (no setup)
