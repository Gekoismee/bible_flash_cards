2015.02.09 : Clean up
	* added readme.md
	* got rid of code that was commented out
	* slight ui tweaks based on cursor trail to navigate around.
	* Things left to knock out:

		- Create reset/restart option
		- Create game setup (choose ordered or shuffled.)

	* Bootstrap simple sidebar
	* angular-filter
	* added configuration screen, don't like it but it's a start
	* refactored and moved things around the tree
	* works in Chrome (LOL)
	* knock out list item done : specific chapters of questions can be selected instead of 502 questions with no middle navigation

2015.02.04 : Concept and beginning of the project.
Things to knock out:
	* [done] Create data model
	* [done] Create the flash card interface (done : phase 1)
	* [done] Create the question loop. (simple top to bottom list navigation)
	* Establish cookie that lets us resume where we left off on a page refresh.

		- to begin with it will just be all cards in order so I can at least give the kids something. (no setup)
